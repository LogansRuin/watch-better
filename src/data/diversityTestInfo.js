      'Speaking means dialogue, not fight grunts. For animated films, we checked IMDb and counted a character as non-white if she was voiced by a non-white actor. Originally, the test didn’t specify that the character had to speak English but rather asked if she spoke “in the language of the release,” but all the movies we watched were English-language anyway.'
